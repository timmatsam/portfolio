          I switched my career from medicine to programming. My background
          consisted of experiences such as hard science research e.g. pancreatic
          cancer, patenting a therapeutic drug, etc. Now as a graduate from a
          web development bootcamp, I hope to be able to pursue positions in
          backend, frontend or both and connect my expertise as a student of
          biology to them so as to solving challenging problems. My hobbies
          include reading, playing and improvising on the piano, and I am
          interested in infrastructure and machine learning (transportation,
          architecture). Currently job searching so letâ€™s link up!{" "}
