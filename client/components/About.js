      <p>
        I recently switched my career from healthcare to programming. My
        background consisted of things such as researching pancreatic cancer and
        working as a pathology assistant. I am now a fresh graduate with
        expertise as a full stack web developer in which my skill set is
        primarily Node.js, React and PostgreSQL. I love to read - my favorite
        device of last year was the Kindle - and currently my interests lie in
        infrastructure (transportation, architecture) as well improvising on
        piano (I love classical music) and learning electric guitar (I also love
        rock). Currently job searching so let’s link up!
