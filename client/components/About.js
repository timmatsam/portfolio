      <p>
        I recently switched my career from healthcare to programming. My
        background consisted of things such as researching pancreatic cancer and
        working as a pathology assistant. I am now a fresh graduate with
        expertise as a full stack web developer in which my skill set is
        primarily Node.js, React and PostgreSQL. I love to read - my favorite
        device of last year was the Kindle - and currently my interests lie in
        infrastructure (transportation, architecture) as well as 2D and 3D
        design. Currently job searching so letâ€™s link up! Give me a call.{" "}
