      I have a kindle.
      My spotify playlist is 70% JPop/JRock, the other 30% is every
      other language in the world, including classical music. You
      NEED to have classical music in your playlist, or you're
      simply not cultured. I enjoy traveling - domestically and internationally.
      Domestic travel involves going to the italian restaurant down the street.
      International travel refers to travel time greater than 30 minutes in any direction (by car).
      On a serious note, if I do travel I NEVER pay for a checked bag.
      Here's a tip: always bring a duffel bag and
      backpack instead of paying $50 - $100 each way for luggage. That's theft.
      My current passions involve watching/reading thing after thing in regards
      to urban planning and design.
      America has incredibly poor infrastructure; our public transporation and
      our inability to provide high/mid-density housing instead of detached,
      single family homes is not prudent. Trust me, you'll
      be much happier if you could walk/bike to your local USPS store to deliver
      that postcard to whomever is contrarian enough to appreciate the gesture.
      Trains are cool. A Super Conducting Maglev train that travels at 600km/hr is WICKED COOL.
