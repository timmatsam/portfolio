# stackathon
An independent project done during the latter half of a week as per the requirement in completing Full Stack Academy. 
My project involved created a 3D rendering of a fictional solar system using the powerfull Three.js library. 

Project will be modified and advanced to a full web application that showcases a complete, accurately portrayed system of stars.
